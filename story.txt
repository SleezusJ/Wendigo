//PROLOGUE
The truck rattles along as you drive endless miles. Gaps let the cold in and it is begining to snow...
The road still looks okay but you've only seen a handful of other drivers in the past few hours.
How long has it been since you've been here?
Something like ten years.


//TRUCK 
//Responses 
//--look around
The cab of the truck suddenly feels too small. The drive didn't do your back any favors either.
Snow is already starting to blanket the windshield.
Time to exit the TRUCK.

//--exit TRUCK
You get out of the truck, feet crunching into a rapidly growing layer of snow.
If you don't hurry


//DRIVEWAY
Your surroundings give you a pang of familiarity. Something from another life.
You turn off the main street and after a while make the sharp turn into the DRIVEWAY. 
You put the truck in park and stretch in the seat.
The GARAGE is in front of you and the adjoining HOUSE, off to the left.
